# TOMATO LEAF DISEASE DETECTION

This project provides a **Tomato Leaf Disease Detection** model using deep learning techniques, specifically based on a **VGG16-like architecture** with custom layers. The model is designed to classify tomato leaves into 10 different categories, including diseases such as Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late Blight, and more, as well as healthy leaves.

The dataset includes diverse images sourced from farms, family, and friends, ensuring a wide representation of disease conditions.

## Dataset

- You can access the **Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset** published on **Mendeley Data** using the following link:
  - [Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zfv4jj7855/1)

The dataset includes images labeled into 10 classes, aiding the model in identifying various leaf conditions with high accuracy.

## Model
